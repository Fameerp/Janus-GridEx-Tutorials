Janus GridEx Tutorials
======================

Tutorials from the Janus GridEx Trial Download - Net 4, VS 2012. Because the supplied ones did not compile.

You will need to download the Janus WinForms Controls Suite v4.0 (Trial Setup)
[http://www.janusys.com/controls/](http://www.janusys.com/controls/ "Janus Controls")

I found that some of these Tutorials did not compile due to namespace issues, something to do with the re-generation of JSNorthWindDataSet.xsd.

Seem to work now. The tutorial programs target .Net4, but the Janus product targets .Net2

An Impressive Windows Forms Grid.
